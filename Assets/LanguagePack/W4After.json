Boss and Rose
Boss: You've got so strong...
you really remind me of your mother...
Rose: Don't you dare talk about Mom, you have no right!
Boss: Well you won, you deserve to hear what really happened on that fateful day.
Me, your mom and Seven. We were part of the original Trinity squad.
Seven has always been a great strategist and that is why this lie continues even today... it has been well told and well thought out.
He made a suicidal plan where he knew your mother would sacrifice herself to save the Earth and in that perfect plan, he managed to frame me as the traitor of Trinity.
He always had tremendous charisma and never made a mistake in his calculations, so his story was widely accepted by the galactic council and I was exiled as the traitor.
You don't have to believe me, but you deserve to hear the truth about what happened to your mother...

Me, Lily, and Seven. We were part of the original Trinity.
Seven has always been a great strategist and that is why this lie continues even today... it has been well told and well thought out.
He made a suicidal plan where Lily would sacrifice herself to save the Earth and in that perfect plan, he managed to frame me as Trinity's traitor.
He always had tremendous charisma and never made a mistake in his calculations, so his story was widely accepted by the galactic council and I was exiled as the traitor.
You don't have to believe me, but you deserve to hear the truth and be aware of Seven's next plans... for the sake of the planet earth.
