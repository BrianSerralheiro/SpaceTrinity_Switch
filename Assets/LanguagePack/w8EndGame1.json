Text1=Three Months Later
Rose1=How're the repairs going?
Luna1=Everything as planned. The collection of the machines that the Seven and the Queen used is already underway.
Luna2=The planet suffered a lot of damage but I believe in a few weeks everything will be fine.
Rose2=Good... Sigh
Aryan1=You need to rest, Rose.
Rose3=Don't worry, I'm fine hahaha
Aryan2=Ok...
Zarina1=So it looks like everything will be fine.
Chunhua1=Well? Do you know how many ships I still need to fix?
Tomoyo1=Now, you better not start crying Chunhua...
Tomoyo2=You said yourself that you were the best for this job.
Tomoyo3=So don't start complaining!
Chunhua2=Sure...
Bruna1=Y'all very loud as always hahaha
Bruna2=Then I can finally announce my plans.
Tomoyo4=You called everyone here, I hope it's a good reason.
Bruna3=Relax, I'm sure you won't regret it.
Bruna4=Due to the incident with former Commander Seven, Trinity will have to work harder so that a case like this doesn't happen again.
Bruna5=Therefore, we will need a new commander, and because I'm the most experienced I'm applying for the position of commander!
Rose4=Bruna will be the new commander?! But what about our team?
Bruna6=Relax. Aryan will take my place.
Aryan3=I blindly trusted Seven and ended up getting off track.
Aryan4=I know it will take time for me to be forgiven but...
Rose5=Don't worry!I know that you will do your best from now on!
Aryan5=Rose...
Bruna7=I will need you to keep an eye on these two during the missions, Luna.
Luna3=You can leave to me! 
Text2=Whaat!?
Chunhua3=Now I'm going to have to put up with this.
Zarina2=I hope you don't lose focus during our missions.
Tomoyo5=And I hope I don't have to keep separating these two all the time.
Text3=Hahahahahaha!
Text4=Thanks for playing!
