Rose1=Wait!
Rose2=Your voice... I know it from somewhere.
Boss1_1=Of course you do, I was one of the closest people to you.
Rose3=D-Dad?! What are you doing?
Rose4=You have taken Mom away from me, now you want to take Trinity and my friends?
Boss1_2=It was Trinity by itself who took your mother from you, a corrupt and disgusting organization.
Boss1_3=Apparently he managed to deceive even my own daughter!
Boss2_1=So you're not going to give up are you?
Luna1=It is Trinity's duty to stop people like you!
Boss2_2=So innocent... If you only knew what that man did and how corrupt the trinity organization is...
Boss2_3=It doesn't matter, you won't stop me!
Bruna1=Tired of running with your tail between your legs?
Boss3_1=I'm not running. You don't even know what that guy plans or what he did with the Trinity organization...
Bruna2=If you tell me, it would be easier to understand.
Boss3_2=It doesn't matter, it all ends now!
Boss4_1=I admire your persistence.
Tomoyo1=My my, Thanks for the compliment.
Tomoyo2=When I have a prey, I only stop when I catch it. Now surrender!
Boss4_2=I will not surrender like that. Not without a fight!
Boss5_1=How did you get through my army?
Chunhua1=I've told ya, this junkyard is nothing compared to my spaceship.
Zarina1=I see that you won't surrender.
Boss6_1=Yes...I can't go back to Trinity right now.
Zarina2=Return to Trinity? What are you talking about?
Boss6_2=It doesn't matter... Let's get this over with!
