Rose1=Wow it looks amazing! Next time I will bring my friends along!
Luna1=The ocean has been sighted, preparing necessary measures against aquatic threats.
Bruna1=Geez!! I forgot my bathing suit, I didn't even know it was going to be a beach day..
Tomoyo1=My my, It looks like we're having sushi for dinner.
Chunhua1=hahaha, how many specimens we have here? 
Chunhua2=That's incredible
Chunhua3=Which one should I start with?
Zarina1=Look at this ocean, It reminded me of my childhood fishing with my friend Igor... The bear.
Boss1_1=My my, it looks like there's a stray cat here.
Rose2=Are you the one who is rising the tide of the planet?
Rose3=That'll ruin the beach for my friends and everyone else!
Boss1_2=My my, your fear is cute indeed.
Boss1_3=I'm sure my crabs will receive you with open arms.
Boss2_1=My my, isn't it past time for kids to go to sleep?
Luna2=...
Luna3=Don't make me waste my time here, stop immediately raising the sea level.
Luna4=You're making the life difficult for people who live on the coast.
Boss2_2=My my, why should I obey a little child?
Boss2_3=You should have more respect towards elders.
Boss2_4=My crabs are going to teach you a lesson.
Bruna2=Are you the owner of this piggery?
Boss3_1=My my, what a lack of respect.
Boss3_2=Didn't they teach you good manners?
Bruna3=Stop messing around with our beautiful ocean!
Boss3_3=If you don't leave peacefully, my crabs will teach you a lesson.
Boss4_1=My my...
Tomoyo2=My my...
Boss4_2=It looks like we have an unexpected guest here, doesn't it?
Tomoyo3=You've been raising the sea level.
Tomoyo4=So I had to leave my base to resolve it.
Boss4_3=My my, so let's settle this then.
Tomoyo5=My my, it seems that we can agree with that at least.
Chunhua4=Did you know that by raising the sea level, you put thousands of species that live on the surface at risk?
Boss5_1=My my, I don't care about the surface lives.
Boss5_2=Only with my ideal world covered by marine beauty.
Chunhua5=Although I am curious about the possible mutations of creatures on the surface.
Chunhua6=I can't help but take into account the majority who will die in the process!
Chunhua7=I'll stop you here and now!
Zarina2=Stop rising the sea!
Boss6_1=My my, and who are you to give me orders?
Zarina3=If you continue with this, it will end life on the surface and consequently my friends.
Boss6_2=My my, did you come here on behalf of the people on the surface?
Boss6_3=I think I can have some fun with you then.
Rose4=Look, look, Luna! Is the sea!
Luna5=Can you be quiet and pay attention to the mission?!
Rose5=Boring...
Bruna4=We should bring our friends and spend the holidays here. What do you think Rose?
Rose6=This is a great idea, Bruna!
Bruna5=So on the way back we can talk to them.
Rose7=Hey, Tomoyo, can you make sushi once we're done?
Tomoyo6=My my, I can if you do a good job
Rose8=Then I will do my best!
Rose9=Chunhua, we can catch some fish for--
Chunhua8=I know, I know, to study them later!
Rose10=I wasn't going to say that...
Rose11=This is going to be easy!
Zarina4=As expected from a Trinity pilot! You can leave the support with me
Rose12=Alright!
Rose13=Look, look, Luna! Is the sea!
Luna6=Can you be quiet and pay attention to the mission?!
Rose14=Boring...
Bruna6=We should take advantage of being on the beach and call others later!
Luna7=We don't have time for this.
Bruna7=You could be less boring some times hahaha!
Luna8=Enemies detected, starting combat mode.
Tomoyo7=My my, it looks like we have some prey to play with.
Luna9=Do the honors.
Tomoyo8=Okay, let the hunt begin!
Chunhua9=Look at these robots. I think I'll get some of them to do experiments!
Luna10=Okay, but focus on the mission.
Chunhua10=Of course! ...boring as always.
Zarina5=So this is the region with high tide problems.
Luna11=Yes, we've to get the person responsible for this!
Zarina6=Very well Luna. Rest assured, we will win on behalf of Trinity!
Bruna8=We should bring our friends and spend the holidays here. What do you think Rose?
Rose15=This is a great idea, Bruna!
Bruna9=So on the way back we can talk to them.
Bruna10=We should take advantage of being on the beach and call others later!
Luna12=We don't have time for this.
Bruna11=You could be less boring some times hahaha!
Bruna12=I think that stopping by here would be good after this mission.
Tomoyo9=I can't help but agree with you! We need to relax some times
Chunhua11=I hope that some rare marine species will appear so that I can study them!
Bruna13=Nice! but don't forget the mission.
Zarina7=I can't let the tide rise any more than that. Many lives are at risk
Bruna14=So we just need to end the whoever is responsible for this.
Rose16=Hey, Tomoyo, can you make sushi once we're done?
Tomoyo10=My my, I can if you do a good job
Rose17=Then I will do my best!
Tomoyo11=My my, wouldn't be better for you to return to the base while you can, shorty?
Luna13=Shut up, I can fight them too!
Tomoyo12=Then show me, how you hunt!
Bruna15=I think that stopping by here would be good after this mission.
Tomoyo13=I can't help but agree with you! We need to relax some times
Tomoyo14=This seems to be the place.
Chunhua12=Are we going to get some good samples around here?
Tomoyo15=This is up to you. Just don't complain if they are too damaged.
Tomoyo16=It seems likely to be an easy ride
Zarina8=I already said that it's not good to underestimate enemies, Tomoyo.
Tomoyo17=Don't give me that. I know you think these enemies are weak, too!
Rose18=Chunhua, we can catch some fish for--
Chunhua13=I know, I know, to study them later!
Rose19=I wasn't going to say that...
Chunhua14=Look at these robots. I think I'll get some of them to do experiments!

Chunhua17=Are we going to get some good samples around here?
Tomoyo19=This is up to you. Just don't complain if they are too damaged.
Zarina9=We can't allow the sea to rise like that!
Chunhua18=This is true! This will wipe out the species I could find on land. I can't allow that!
Rose20=This is going to be easy!
Zarina10=As expected from a Trinity pilot! You can leave the support with me
Rose21=Alright!
Zarina11=So this is the region with high tide problems.
Luna15=Yes, we've to get the person responsible for this!
