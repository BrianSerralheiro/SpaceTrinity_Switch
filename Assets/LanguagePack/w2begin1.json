Luna1=The ocean has been sighted, preparing necessary measures against aquatic threats.
Bruna1=Geez!! I forgot my bathing suit, I didn't even know it was going to be a beach day..
Tomoyo1=My my, It looks like we're having sushi for dinner.
Chunhua1=hahaha, how many specimens we have here? 
Chunhua2=That's incredible
Chunhua3=Which one should I start with?
Zarina1=Look at this ocean, It reminded me of my childhood fishing with my friend Igor... The bear.
Boss1_1=My my, it looks like there's a stray cat here.
Rose2=Are you the one who is rising the tide of the planet?

Luna3=Don't make me waste my time here, stop immediately raising the sea level.
Luna4=You're making the life difficult for people who live on the coast.
Boss2_2=My my, why should I obey a little child?
Boss2_3=You should have more respect towards elders.
Boss2_4=My crabs are going to teach you a lesson.
Bruna2=Are you the owner of this piggery?
Boss3_1=My my, what a lack of respect.

Tomoyo4=So I had to leave my base to resolve it.
Boss4_3=My my, so let's settle this then.
Tomoyo5=My my, it seems that we can agree with that at least.
Chunhua4=Did you know that by raising the sea level, you put thousands of species that live on the surface at risk?
Boss5_1=My my, I don't care about the surface lives.

Boss6_1=My my, and who are you to give me orders?
Zarina3=If you continue with this, it will end life on the surface and consequently my friends.
Boss6_2=My my, did you come here on behalf of the people on the surface?
Boss6_3=I think I can have some fun with you then.
