Seven1=Good job.
Seven2=Shield as you can guess will equip your spaceship with an extra source of health.

Seven: Now last but not least:
Special is your spaceship signature move, each spaceship has a specific number of specials you can use based on your special bar.
Some spaceships require a lot of mana in order to use like Zarina's and some of them don't require as much like Chunhua's.

Get the special power-up from the drone and press "X" or "ZL" in order to use it.

-Demonstration of drone(special)-

Seven: Alright! 
Good luck and always remember,
Everyone is counting with you!
